# hive-testbench
My own version of Hive benchmark test HDP 2.3


Need to install MAven first in the environnement this installation use maven of the hive-testbench

I uploaded the right zip file tpcds_kit.zip cause the link is not right from hortonworks version hive-testbench

The maven is not redownloaded each time you launch the bench that was the problem i face due to proxy.

Fell free to give me feedback
